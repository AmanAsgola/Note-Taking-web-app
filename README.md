# Note-Taking-web-app
It is a web based application, written in python.
It gives user the functionality to easily save and delete his notes
The user needs to create an account and then just sign-in . Once the user is signed-in , he can add any note he wants.
It allows the user to save his important notes in a secure place which needs authentication before accessing to those notes.
The advantage of this web application is that even if the system in which the notes are made gets crash, we can access those notes in any other device.
